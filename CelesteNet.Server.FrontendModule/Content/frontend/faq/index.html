                        Once you've installed the mod and opened the game, go into <strong>Mod Options</strong> and find CelesteNet's settings section. Activate the <strong>Connected</strong> option. That's it!<br />

                        Yes, chat is moderated and should be PG-13 or "safe for work". There's a dedicated <a href="/rules">rules page</a>, please read it before joining. We want our community to be welcoming and inclusive
                        for everyone!
                        <br />
                        Usually we will issue at least one warning kick before we ban, unless there's very obvious trolling going on. Kicks and bans always have a reason attached to them.

                        <a class="faq-anchor" href="#howto-register">#4</a>
                        How do I register? How do I get my profile picture in-game?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        Currently, the only way to register is to link a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> account.
                        You can always join as a Guest, unless Lockdown is in effect.
                        See also entry <a href="#howto-lockdown">#5</a>.<br />
                        Registration is done on the <a href="/#user">front page</a> in the section titled <strong>Your Profile</strong>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is recommended you do this on the same device you play CelesteNet on.</li>
                            <li>Once you've registered, you should see your username and profile picture under <strong>Your Profile</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Now you need to click <strong>Send to Client</strong> right below that or manually set your key in-game.</li>
                            <li>Your key should look similar to this: <samp>#01ab23cde5671fab</samp>. It acts like a passphrase to identify you to the server, so keep it <em><strong>secret</strong>!</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        Some browsers' security features might block the website from communicating with the game. When that happens, set your key manually.<br />
                        <br />
                        After you've set your key in-game, you will have to <strong>reconnect</strong> to start using the new name/profile!<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Additional information:</strong><br />
                        The registration uses the OAuth2 protocol, similar to how you can sign up to services using your Google or Facebook account.
                        When registering, CelesteNet will get some information about you from Discord &mdash; namely your username, discriminator (<samp>#1234</samp>) and profile picture.<br />
                        <br />
                        This profile information <strong>does not sync</strong> automatically. To update your CelesteNet appearance, click on your username on the <a href="/#user">front page</a>,
                        link your Discord account once more, and reconnect to CelesteNet in-game.
                        The changes should be reflected immediately.

                        This means the server has been put into Lockdown mode, meaning only registered players can join.<br />

                        Are there any differences between Guests and registered users?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        There are some differences, the most obvious one being the lack of profile pictures for Guests.<br />
                        Some more technical limitations exist, because the server will not store certain data unless you're registered.<br />
                        <br />
                        This means Guests cannot <u>toggle</u>...
                        <ul>
                            <li>... incoming whispers via <samp>/whisper</samp></li>
                            <li>... between automatic global/channel chat mode via <samp>/channelchat</samp> or <samp>/globalchat</samp></li>
                            <li>... teleports from others via <samp>/tpon</samp> and <samp>/tpoff</samp></li>
                        </ul>
                        <sup>
                            Please also note that short-hand command aliases like <samp>/w</samp>, <samp>/cc</samp> and <samp>/gc</samp> exist, and the same things apply.
                            <!-- See the <a href="/chat#commands">CelesteNet chat guide</a> for more information about chat commands and their aliases.-->
                        </sup><br />
                        The limitations only apply to the toggle aspects of those commands. Guest <em>can</em> still send whispers, individual channel chat messages and teleport to people.

                    <div class="text-body">
                        There is only one official CelesteNet server, the same server this website is hosted on. It is located in Germany,
                        hosted by <a href="https://0x0a.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x0ade</a> with Hetzner.<br />
                        If you want to play privately with a couple of friends, you most likely want to join a private channel rather than host your own server.<br />

                        How do I create and use channels?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        By default you will be in the channel <samp>main</samp>, like most other players.<br />
                        Press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to open up the player list, letting you see the player count, your current channel at the top and other channels below.<br />
                        <br />
                        You can create or <strong>join</strong> a channel by sending the command <samp>/join mychannel</samp> in chat, replacing <samp>mychannel</samp> with the name of
                        your channel &ndash; if it does not yet exist, the server will create it for you.<br />
                        <sub><strong>NB:</strong> The command <samp>/channel</samp> is <em>exactly</em> the same as the <samp>/join</samp> command, it is an alias.</sub><br />
                        <br />
                        You can create or join a <strong>private</strong> channel by prefixing the channel name with a <samp>!</samp>, e.g. <samp>/join !mysecretchannel</samp> &mdash; keep
                        in mind that the "secret" name could be guessed by others if it is too simple.
                        Private channel names are hidden from anyone who isn't in it.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Currently channel names are case-sensitive. This means <samp>!MyChannel</samp> and <samp>!mychannel</samp> are two different channels!
                        This may be changed in the future.

                        Simply being in the same level <em>(and in the same CelesteNet channel!)</em> as another player should let you see them and play with them.

                        I keep accidentally grabbing/throwing people! What are "Interactions"?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        <strong>Interactions</strong> are a feature that lets you bounce on other players' heads and grab and throw them similar to Theo crystals.
                        Both players need to have <strong>Interactions</strong> enabled (in CelesteNet's Mod Options) for this to work.<br />
                        However this feature can be a little buggy and lead to accidental grabs and throws, so we recommend setting "Interactions" to "Off" most of the time.

                            (Also, if you've been thrown into solid tiles or got otherwise stuck due to interactions and <strong>can't even open the Pause menu</strong>,
                            use the game's Debug map accessed with <kbd>F6</kbd> or send <samp>/tp &lt;someone&gt;</samp> to teleport yourself out)

                        Can I use other mods, assist mode, cheat mode or variant mode?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes!<br />
                        Generally all of these are permitted. What is not allowed, however, is using them to cheat in competitive contexts, such as racing or Madhunt matches.<br />
                        Also, you shouldn't excessively use invincibility, infinite dashing or other gameplay changes to harass others or to prevent them from being able to play and enjoy the game.
                        Any such misconduct may result in a warning kick by the CelesteNet moderation. Feel free to report any such issues to us and we will handle it.

                        How do I change my character’s hair and appearance? Can I use skin mods?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        Celestenet itself only synchronizes hair length and hair colors, as well as "vanilla" player sprite variations such as the <em>Other Self</em> variant, no-backpack Variant, etc.<br />
                        If you're using a custom skin mod (e.g. <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/251814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niko from OneShot</a>
                        or <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/385893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ralsei from Deltarune</a>) other players will still see you as regular Madeline even if they have the mod too.
                        Additionally, every other player may appear the same way as yourself. So you will see everyone as Niko or Ralsei, regardless of which skin they're using.<br />
                        <br />
                        Popular hair and skin mods that fully support CelesteNet include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/14871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hyperline</strong></a> &mdash; customize hair color and length per dash-count. Supports things like gradients and rainbow hair.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/251795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prideline</strong></a> &mdash; turn your hair colors into LGBTQ+ pride flags!</li>

                        <strong>Note:</strong> The hair length sent to other players will be capped at 12 segments (Madeline's default hair is 4 or 5 in length depending on dash count).<br />

                        <a class="faq-anchor" href="#howto-emotes">#15</a>
                        How can I use Emotes? What different types of Emotes are avaliable?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        Sometimes it can be a bit confusing when people ask about Emotes. There's essentially three things you could be asking about.
                        <h4>1. Emotes in Chat:</h4>
                        <em>Emotes</em> or <strong>emoji</strong> within chat work very similar to how they work on Discord.<br />
                        You surround the name of the <em>emoji</em> with <samp>:</samp>, for example <samp>:glad:</samp> is a default <em>emoji</em> added by Everest.<br />
                        When you type <samp>:</samp> you should already see a list of available <em>emoji</em> being suggested. Once you accept
                        a suggestion (with <kbd>Tab</kbd>) or type it out fully, it should replace itself with its icon in the input already. You can still remove or edit it as normal text.<br />
                        <br />
                        Technically any Celeste Mod you install can add new <em>emoji</em> and only those who also have it will see them. Otherwise they will only see the text, e.g. the literal <samp>:frogeline:</samp>.
                        One popular mod that adds most of the <em>emoji</em> from the official Celeste Discord is <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/53673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CelesteEmojis</a>.<br />
                        Everest adds these default emoji: <samp>:glad:</samp> <samp>:thinking:</samp> <samp>:gladbw:</samp> <samp>:thinkingbw:</samp> <samp>:checkpoint:</samp> <samp>:everest:</samp>. Try them out!
                        <h4>2. Emotes in-game:</h4>
                        These emotes are things like <strong>animated character portraits</strong> that pop up above you or someone else's Madeline. They can also simply be text.<br />
                        You activate these with the row of number keys <kbd>1</kbd> - <kbd>9</kbd> on keyboard or by opening the Emote Wheel by moving the right analog stick on a controller.
                        Press the stick down to send a selected emote.<br />
                        Additionally you can send these emotes with the <samp>/emote</samp> or <samp>/e</samp> command in chat. Check <samp>/help emote</samp> to learn about the command's syntax.<br />
                        These emotes can only be used to show portraits/textures from the game itself, no custom images!
                        You can customize the preset emotes for the number keys and emote wheel by editing <samp>modsettings-CelesteNet.Client.celeste</samp> in your Celeste <samp>Saves/</samp> folder.
                        <h4>3. EmoteMod:</h4>
                        Another popular version of "emotes" are added by <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/6846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EmoteMod</a>.
                        With this mod you can trigger <strong>animations of your character</strong>, e.g. Madeline spinning, her idle animations, sitting down, and many others.<br />
                        Animations played via this mod can be seen by everyone, whether they have the mod themselves or not, since the animations are just Madeline's regular sprite animations.

                        How do I find others to play with?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="text-body">
                        The easiest way to find others is to simply ask in global chat!<br />
                        Make suggestions like playing a certain A-, B- or C-Side, attempting to get a Heart or Golden Berry you still need, or playing maps from a modded Collab like Spring Collab 2020 or Strawberry Jam.<br />
                        You can also join the <a href="https://discord.gg/celeste" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Celeste Discord server</a> and give yourself the <samp>@celestenetter</samp> role.
                        Whenever you feel like playing with others, ping this role in <samp>#celestenet</samp> and suggest something to do. Others may do the same!<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Note:</strong> A lot of people have that Discord role. Because of that, there's a rule in place to only respond to pings if you can join! There's no need for a dozen people to say "No".
                        If the pings are getting too much, you can always remove the role again.
