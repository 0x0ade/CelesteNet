                    <h2>CelesteNet rules? Heck yeah it does!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jokes aside, let's be real &mdash; any community needs some rules and guidelines, to make sure everyone is having fun and feels welcome to participate.<br />
                        That is why we've adopted/adapted the rules of the <a href="https://discord.gg/celeste">official Celeste Discord server</a> to cover CelesteNet as well.<br />
                        <br />
                        These rules apply to <strong>global chat</strong> and the default channel of "<strong>main</strong>".<br />
                        <br />
                        <em>(For other channels, especially private ones and whispers, we usually don't actively monitor those as much, but please try to also stick to the rules there!)</em><br />
                        <br />
                        Failure to follow the rules <strong>will</strong> result in warnings, kicks and ultimately bans, as deemed necessary by the Team.<br />
                        <br />
                        We, the CelesteNet Team, try to always have an eye on what's going on in CelesteNet and its global chat, but we can't guarantee to always catch everything as it happens.<br />
                        So if you see someone breaking these rules, something makes you uncomfortable or someone is trying to ruin your CelesteNet experience, please report it to us in the <strong>#celestenet</strong> channel on
                        the <a href="https://discord.gg/celeste">Celeste Discord</a>.<br />
                        You can also contact one of the members with the <strong>@CelesteNet Team</strong> role in DMs if you want.

                    <h1>CelesteNet Rules</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Please only use <strong>English</strong> for conversations in global chat and the "main" channel, as extended discussion in other languages is difficult to moderate.<br />
                            <em>(This rule does <strong>not</strong> apply to other channel chats, private or otherwise, nor does it apply to whispers!)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't harass or discriminate against others, including using slurs or words in any way that put down a specific group of people, even when not used to refer to those groups. Changing or censoring a banned word in an attempt to bypass this rule is prohibited.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion about NSFW, disturbing, or malicious content is not allowed. We want CelesteNet to be family-friendly, so your content should remain appropriate for all users. Swears are allowed in moderation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be respectful and understanding of others, and avoid making people uncomfortable or otherwise ruining their fun. We all get upset at times, but negativity should stay at a reasonable level, as it drains everyone else.<br />
                            This especially also applies to venting rage, anger and frustration in general chat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't cause or contribute to drama. This includes discussion about politics, religion, gossip about other people, and any other controversial topics, as they often cause unnecessary arguments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No spamming, such as posting chains of emotes, excessively long text, or gibberish.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User profiles, including but not limited to Username, Nickname, and Profile Picture, as well as (public) channel names are subject to moderation in accordance to the rules, in particular rules 2 and 3.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
